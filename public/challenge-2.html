// Challenge #2 is to build a script in JS that models Bob's behavior.
// - Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.
// - Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.
// - He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him. THAT MEANS ALL CAPS!
// - He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
// anything.
// - He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

	} else if ((input === input.toUpperCase()) && (input !== "")) {
		return alert("Whoa, chill out!");
	} else if (input == false) {
		return alert("Fine. Be that way!");
	} else {
		return alert("Whatever.")
	}
